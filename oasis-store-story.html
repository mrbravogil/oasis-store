                <div class="t-s-text"><p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 500;">Oasis, formed in 1991 in Manchester, England, became one of the most influential rock bands of the 1990s. The 
            band's core members were brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, whose volatile relationship became central to their 
            identity. Initially known as The Rain, they rebranded to Oasis after Noel joined, bringing his songwriting 
            talents to the forefront. Their debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994), was an instant success, capturing the 
            essence of Britpop with anthems like "Live Forever" and "Supersonic."
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px;">
            Their follow-up, (What's the Story) Morning Glory (1995), propelled them to global superstardom, featuring 
            hits like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger." This album marked a peak in their commercial success, 
            and Oasis became synonymous with 90s rock. Their sound blended the spirit of classic rock with a new, raw 
            energy, drawing influences from bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.
            <br><br>
            Despite their success, internal tensions between Noel and Liam often threatened the band's stability. These 
            tensions were well-documented in the media, but Oasis continued to dominate the music scene. Their 1997 album 
            Be Here Now sold over 8 million copies worldwide, although critical reception was mixed. The band’s live 
            performances were legendary, with massive crowds at Knebworth in 1996, where they played to over 250,000 fans 
            over two nights.
            <br><br>
            Throughout the late 90s and early 2000s, Oasis released several more albums, including Standing on the 
            Shoulder of Giants (2000), Heathen Chemistry (2002), and Don’t Believe the Truth (2005), maintaining a loyal 
            fan base despite evolving musical landscapes. Their music ranged from hard-hitting rock to more introspective, 
            acoustic-driven songs, showcasing the depth of Noel's songwriting.

        Oasis’s influence extended beyond their music. Their outspoken personalities, chaotic image, and legendary feuds made 
        them a defining part of the cultural landscape of the 90s. The band's raw energy, especially in their live performances, 
        resonated deeply with fans who saw them as the voice of a generation.

        <br>
        However, tensions within the band led to its dissolution in 2009 after Noel left due to a public altercation with Liam. 
        Despite their breakup, the legacy of Oasis endures, with their songs continuing to be beloved by fans worldwide. Both Noel 
        and Liam pursued solo careers, but Oasis’s impact on rock music remains undeniable.
        <br>
        <br>
        Oasis's music is celebrated for its anthemic qualities, emotional depth, and the iconic voice of Liam Gallagher. The 
        band’s place in music history is secure, with a catalogue that continues to inspire both musicians and fans alike. The 
        Gallagher brothers, while separated, remain influential figures in rock, ensuring that the story of Oasis will live on 
        for generations to come.
